## CouchDB

  * [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)

  * [BigCouch](http://github.com/cloudant/bigcouch) is a highly available,
    fault-tolerant, clustered, mostly api-compliant version of
    [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/).

    While it appears to the end-user as one CouchDB instance, it is in fact
    one or more nodes in an elastic cluster, acting in concert to store and
    retrieve documents, index and serve views, and serve CouchApps. BigCouch
    has been developed and is continually maintained by Cloudant who offer
    hosted CouchDB as a service.

    Clusters behave according to concepts outlined in Amazon's Dynamo paper,
    namely that each node can accept requests, data is placed on partitions
    based on a consistent hashing algorithm, and quorum protocols are for
    read/write operations.

## Neo4j

  * [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/)  is a __graph database__. It is an embedded,
    disk-based, fully transactional Java persistence engine that stores data

    and rapid style of development.

  * [Neo4j.rb](http://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j/) includes a Lucene wrapper.

and

  * [InfoGrid](http://infogrid.org/) is an Internet __Graph Database__ with
    many additional software components that make the development of REST-ful
    web applications on a graph foundation easy.

    and deploying Topic Maps-based applications.
