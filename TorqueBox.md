# TorqueBox

  * should implement often required Rails app features using JBoss AS services

    and offer drop-in replacements of popular Rails extensions like
    restful-authentication, Delayed::Job

  * should expose popular JBoss AS and other libraries features to Rails apps

    and allow developers to update their Rails applications with advanced
    features like instant cloud-readyness, enterprise-grade integration or
    service management and monitoring easily


> If I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants.


## Caveat Lector

__All code snippets show proposals only!__ In fact the complete document is a
collection of ideas and proposals.


## Features

TorqueBox should implement or integrate features on-the-fly and in an
unobtrusive manner wherever possible.

Features that depend on JBoss AS should be configured with or inherited from
sources located in separate directories which could be easily excluded if the
Rails app or part of it needs to be deployed traditionally, that is without
JBoss AS.

E.g. `app/dav_presenter`…

### Database Access and Full Text Search

TorqueBox should integrate ActiveRecord behind the scenes with JDBC.

make advanced features like __Hibernate Search__ available to the Rails app.
Such an integration could render external full text search engines like Ferret
or Sphinx and the Rails plug-ins superfluous.

      #
      expose :Document

      # expose the default controller actions (index, show, update, delete…)
      # and include 'fake' documents which will be generated by calling
      # a non-default action and streamed to the WebDAV-client on-the-fly
